#count     <- This states the amount of VMs to be created
#name      <- This states the VM Name, the "${count.index}" allows you to create more than one VM and it'll just count from then e.g.: tf-vm-1, tf-vm-2, tf-vm-3, etc.
#cores     <- The amount of cores that the VM will have
#memory    <- The amount of RAM the VM will have
#disk      <- The disk definitions for the VM, scale the size here.
#network   <- The network bridge definition to be used.
#ipconfig0 <- The Ip for the VM, the "${count.index}" allows you to create more than one VM and it'll just count from then e.g.: 10.10.10.151, 10.10.10.152, etc.
